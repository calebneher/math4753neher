\title{Monte Carlo Central Limit Theorem for Uniform Distribution}
\usage{
mycltu(n, iter, a = 0, b = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Sample size for each iteration.}

\item{iter}{Number of repeated samples.}

\item{a}{Lower bound of the uniform distribution.}

\item{b}{Upper bound of the uniform distribution.}
}
\value{
A histogram comparing empirical and theoretical sampling distributions.
}
\description{
This function draws repeated samples from a Uniform(a,b) distribution,
computes sample means, and plots their histogram along with a kernel density curve
and the theoretical normal curve predicted by the Central Limit Theorem.
